## My process

### General info

Blogr landing page made with design from Frontend Mentor.

### Technologies

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

HTML

Using wrapper for whole page to remove horizontal scroll while having position absolute element going out of page scope.

CSS

Better control of images

JS

Still need more practice, bet it could be a lot better. Practiced toggling classes.


### Continued development

Need to focus more on good use and knowing of Javascript and control of html/css images/backgrounds position. Definitely also need to try make mobile first site and then desktop.
